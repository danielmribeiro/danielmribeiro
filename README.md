| ![Rubberduck](images/rubberduck.jpg) | Hello! Meet "Arménio Durães," my coding buddy. We tackle bugs together — he listens to all my coding rants and helps me find tricky errors. He’s named after two awesome professors from my academic journey who really inspired me. And if you see a quack in the code comments, that’s just AD giving his feedback! 🦆 |

### ☝️ Fun Fact!

Did you know the first computer “bug” was an actual bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth causing issues in their computer and dubbed it the “first real bug.”
If it had been a raccoon, would we now be calling errors “raccoons” and talking about “raccoon issues” in our code?
Just imagine trying to “deracoon” a raccoon from your code! 🦝
